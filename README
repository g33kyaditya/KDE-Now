KDE Now is a Google Now alternative for the KDE Plasma Desktop. It offers valuable information in the form of cards after an e-mail confirming your Event, Flight, Restaurant or Hotel Reservation.

It has a plasmoid front-end for displaying cards and a daemon like backend which fetches emails from your mail continuously. This daemon runs on IMAP protocol so your e-mail provider must support that with IDLE fetaure of IMAP.

Requirements:
-   KDE Desktop running Plasma 5
-   Qt5 >= 5.5
-   CMake >= 2.8
-   ECM >= 0.0.9
-   A compiler, Gcc or Clang (preferably Gcc)
-   The following KDE Frameworks 5 are essential for building it :- Plasma, Declarative, KIMAP, KMime, KIO, KWallet, Config, CoreAddons, Service

Building:
- Clone the source code. (It's available on github as well as KDE quickgit repos)
- cd <cloned directory>
- mkdir build
- cd build
- cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DLIB_INSTALL_DIR=lib[or lib64] -DKDE_INSTALL_USE_QT_SYS_PATHS=ON
- sudo make -j<n> (n : number of cores on CPU + 1 for maximum speed during building)

Installing:
- sudo make install


Running:
- As can be seen from the Demo Video, place the widget called "KDE Now" on your Desktop
- Input your EMail id's credentials (IMAP Address, IMAP port, username and password)
- Provide permissions (click yes) to store these credentials to wallet
- Depending on the number of emails in your mailbox the daemon will download all emails and check them for valid card info.
